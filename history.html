            <h1>History of JavaScript</h1>

            <section>
                <h2>Netscape</h2>
                <p>In 1995, a year after Netscape released their browser called Netscape Navigator, Netscape added a scripting language to their browser to meet the increasing demand for dynamic content and behavior. JavaScript was developed and released in December 1995 in order to fulfill this need. </p>

                <h2>Microsoft</h2>
                <p>Shortly after, Microsoft released their own competitor to Netscape called Internet Explorer. Microsoft managed to reverse engineer Netscape’s JavaScript interpreter and created their own interpreter called JScript. While Internet Explorer was quickly eclipsing Netscape’s Navigator, Netscape left their final stamp on JavaScript’s history by submitting JavaScript to ECMA International, a nonprofit standards organization, leading to the creation of the ECMAScript language specification in June 1997. ECMAScript is a JavaScript standard that is meant to ensure the interoperability of web pages across different browsers. In 2018 ECMAScript 6 (ES6) was fully supported in all modern browsers. The latest version ES 2018, has yet to reach full adoption across all modern browsers.</p>

                <h2>Ajax</h2>
                <p>In 2005, JavaScript’s renaissance period began from Jesse James Garrett’s white paper titled Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications. In Garrett’s paper he coined the term ajax, asynchronous JavaScript, which described a set of JavaScript technologies that could be used to create web applications that loaded data in the background without the need for a full page refresh. Ajax along with many other libraries like jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools, trailblazed the path for the modern web as we know it today.</p>

                <h2>Google</h2>
                <p>In 2008, Google released their own browser called Chrome. What made Chrome significantly faster than its other competitors was it’s unique V8 JavaScript engine. Their V8 engine was a just-in-time (JIT) compiler that allowed the browser to translate JavaScript code into efficient machine code instead of using an interpreter. Google would later help combine all relevant work on JavaScript in an effort to push the language forward. At the end of 2009 these efforts resulted in the creation of ES5.</p>

                <h2>NodeJS</h2>
                <p>In 2009 Ryan Dahl released the first version of Node.js, combining Google’s V8 engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API, resulting in a complete server-side, event-driven JavaScript environment. NodeJS made it easier to share data between client and server-side code, because those developers with experience in client-side JavaScript could begin writing server-side code. NodeJS' popularity gave rise to what is now the largest software package registry in the world; npm.</p>

                <h2>Javascript Today</h2>
                <p>Today’s JavaScript ecosystem is one of many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and an ever growing number of JavaScript being used outside of the browser. With the rise of single page applications and other JavaScript heavy implementations, a number of transpilers, such as TypeScript, have emerged in order to help assist in the development process.</p>
